# AdaptusSoftwareIntern

Clarification:

- I created a branch with my name to upload my code.
-create a file a run.js file so that you can test that the code will work as expected.
- when I used the function to upload to S3 as it did not exist I could not run my code so I left it documented.
-I tried to use as many of the things that came in the template, but some I could not understand how they worked so I did it in a different way I hope it is not negative.


Thanks for the opportunity!!
